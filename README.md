# Emerald Bay

Emerald Bay State Park includes:

- Fannette Island, the only island in Lake Tahoe.
- Vikingsholm, one of the most beautiful examples of Scandinavian architecture in the United States.
- A good deal of hiking trails.

Emerald Bay is a state park on the southwest area of Lake Tahoe and is widely regarded as one of the most beautiful locations in the area, if not the entire United States. It's surrounded by rugged cliffs and features a brilliant blue-green bay that's a favorite spot for photographers.

Here are some of the highlights of Emerald Bay State Park:

3. **Hiking Trails**: The park is full of trails that allow visitors to explore the shoreline of the bay, the forests, and even reach the top of Eagle Falls.

As for parking, Emerald Bay can be tough. The parking lot is not very big and it gets filled quickly, especially during peak times in summer when visitors flock to the park. It usually fills up by 10 am, so the earlier you arrive, the better.

Here are some tips for parking:

- Arrive early. This cannot be stressed enough.
- If possible, try visiting on weekdays when the crowds are less.
- You could look for parking along the road, but be sure you're parked legally. Don't park on the roadway and only use designated parking areas.
- The Eagle Point Campground is an alternative location you can think of parking at, but it does involve a bit of a hike to reach the main areas of the park.
- For those who can’t find parking, consider taking the Tahoe Trolley or booking a boat tour from South Lake Tahoe or Camp Richardson.
- Keep some cash handy. The day-use fee for vehicles is $10 and is on a self-pay system. An important thing to note is that parking spaces cannot be pre-booked or reserved.

Remember that parking and park access can change seasonally and can also be different due to the COVID-19 pandemic, so it's always wise to check the California State Parks website for the most up-to-date information. Enjoy your time at Emerald Bay!

3. **Mariposa Grove**: Home to over 500 mature giant sequoias, the largest trees on the planet. It's about an hour drive from Yosemite Valley.

4. **Tunnel View**: One of the most famous views of Yosemite Valley. From here, you can see El Capitan and Bridalveil Fall rising from Yosemite Valley, with Half Dome in the background.

5. **Yosemite Museum**: Near the Yosemite Village, the museum showcases the cultural history of the Yosemite Miwuk and other Sierra Nevada native people.

6. **Merced River**: The river flows through the valley providing beautiful spots for picnics, as well as places to swim or wade.

7. **Hiking**: There are hikes of all lengths and difficulty levels:
    - Bridalveil Fall Trail is an easy, 0.5-mile round-trip, offering views of Bridalveil Fall from its base.
    - Lower Yosemite Fall Trail is another easy, one-mile loop trail that leads to the base of Lower Yosemite Fall.
    - If your toddler can handle it, the Mist Trail is a must-do hike that takes you to the top of Vernal Falls (3 miles, moderate difficulty).

Yosemite also offers Junior Ranger Programs suitable for kids aged 3-6 and 7-13. Participants complete activities and attend a short ranger-led program to earn a badge.

Most of the Yosemite National Park is open year-round, but some areas like Mariposa Grove and Glacier Point Road are inaccessible by car from approximately November through May due to snow.

Please be aware of potential wildlife encounters - keep your distance and do not feed animals. It's also crucial to follow Leave No Trace principles to help keep the park clean and safe.

Finally, plan everything in advance as cell service is spotty at best in the park. The best strategy for visiting the most popular sites is to start early, as parking can get extremely challenging after mid-morning. Enjoy the natural beauty of Yosemite National Park!

### Yosemite Valley

Yosemite Valley is the crown jewel of Yosemite National Park, stretching approximately 7.5 miles long and up to a mile wide. More than four million visitors each year come to Yosemite Valley for its stunning landmarks, plentiful activities, and large concentration of iconic sites. Here's an in-depth take on what you can explore in Yosemite Valley:

1. **Waterfalls**: The valley is renowned for its spectacular waterfalls, the most famous being Yosemite Falls. The tallest waterfall in North America with a total drop of 2,425 feet, Yosemite Falls is actually made up of three separate falls: Lower Yosemite Fall, Middle Cascades, and Upper Yosemite Fall. Other popular waterfalls include Bridalveil Fall and Vernal Fall.

2. **Half Dome**: This granite dome, standing more than 4,700 feet above the valley floor, is a bucket-list icon for experienced hikers (requires a permit). You may not plan to hike it, but it provides a stunning backdrop.

3. **El Capitan**: This sheer granite cliff is a favorite challenge for experienced rock climbers from around the world. Even for those not climbing, it's an impressive sight.

4. **Yosemite Village**: This is a useful base for exploring the valley offering amenities such as the Yosemite Museum, Ansel Adams Gallery, Village Store, and a post office.

5. **Hiking**: Easy family-friendly trails include the Lower Yosemite Fall trail offering a close-up view of the Lower Yosemite Fall and the half-mile trail to the base of Bridalveil Fall. The Mirror Lake trail (2-mile round-trip to the lake, 5-miles full loop around) is an easy

### Glacier Point

Glacier Point, one of the highlights of Yosemite National Park, provides some of the most magnificent panoramic views you'll find anywhere in the park. It's located approximately 3,214 feet above the valley floor, offering an exceptional overview of Yosemite Valley, including outstanding views of famous landmarks like Half Dome, Yosemite Falls, Nevada and Vernal Falls, and the High Sierra.

Some main highlights include:

1. **Glacier Point Lookout**: From the vantage point of the main lookout, you will get a close-up view of Half Dome. The view is truly breathtaking and is a great photo opportunity. Early morning or late afternoon visits will offer the best lighting for photographs.

2. **Geology Hut**: There's an outdoor geology exhibit, where you can learn how glaciers shaped the landscape.

3. **Glacier Point Trailhead**: This is the trailhead for a few popular hiking trails, including the Four Mile Trail, which winds down into Yosemite Valley, and the Panorama Trail, which offers stunning vistas as it descends to the valley floor. However, these trails might be too strenuous if you're carrying a toddler.

4. **Stargazing**: If you get a chance, sticking around Glacier Point until after dark can offer amazing stargazing opportunities as the elevation and distance from city lights provide unique clarity.

Do note that Glacier Point is generally accessible by car from late May through October or November, depending on snow conditions. When the road is closed, it is still possible to reach Glacier Point on skis or snowshoes.

Parking can sometimes be competitive, especially during the peak summer season. To avoid the busiest times, consider visiting early in the morning or closer to sunset. Be sure to bring sunscreen, water, and a hat as the sun can be intense at this elevation.

(Note: Glacier Point Road will be closed to all traffic in 2022 to rehabilitate and improve the road).

### Hiking in Yosemite

Yosemite National Park offers a range of hiking opportunities. Since you'll be traveling with a toddler, let's stick to some of the less strenuous and more family-friendly trails in the park:

1. **Lower Yosemite Fall Trail**: This is an easy 1-mile loop trail that takes you to the base of Lower Yosemite Fall. The trail is paved and wheelchair accessible. The hike offers great views of both the upper and lower falls and especially stuns in late spring when the waterfall is at its peak.

2. **Bridalveil Fall Trail**: This is a short hike to the base of Bridalveil Falls. The trail is 0.5 miles round trip with some elevation gain. The path can be a bit slippery due to the mist from the waterfall, so make sure to wear shoes with good traction.

3. **Mirror Lake Trail**: This 2-mile round-trip trail (5 miles if you choose to do the full loop around the lake) is relatively flat and leads to a lovely small lake. It's particularly stunning in spring and early summer when the lake is at its fullest.

4. **Wawona Meadow Loop**: If you decide to explore the southern part of Yosemite, this easy 3.5-mile loop around a lovely meadow might be interesting. You'll probably see some wildlife, especially if you start early in the morning.

## Sequoia National Park
Sequoia National Park, situated in the Southern Sierra Nevada in California, is renowned for its majestic, towering sequoia trees, including the General Sherman Tree, the most massive tree on Earth by volume. The park also offers deep caverns, mountain vistas, and abundant wildlife.

Here are some highlights:

Giant Forest: This area is home to half of the Earth's largest and longest-living trees. It's a marvel seeing these astonishing, thousands-of-years-old sequoias.

General Sherman Tree: The star of the park, the General Sherman Tree, is the world's largest tree by volume and is estimated to be over 2,000 years old.

Moro Rock: A granite dome with a staircase that leads to the summit featuring panoramic views of the park (not recommended if scared of heights). It's a relatively short but steep and strenuous hike.

Crystal Cave: A beautiful marble cavern featuring stalactites and stalagmites. You can discover it on guided tours during the summer months. It requires an additional ticket and might not be suitable for very young children.

Crescent Meadow: A beautiful, peaceful meadow labeled by naturalist John Muir as the "Gem of the Sierra". Giant sequoias surround the lush meadow. The 1.6-mile loop trail is relatively flat and winds between stunning displays of wildflowers.

Tunnel Log: A giant sequoia that fell across the road in 1937, it has been tunneled out and now cars can drive right through it, quite a unique experience!

Hiking: If you wish to experience the park by foot, the Congress Trail is an easy-moderate 2-mile loop that takes you through groves of enormous sequoias. For a more advanced hike, try the High Sierra Trail which starts from Crescent Meadow and gives you spectacular views over the park, but this may not be suitable with a toddler.

Sequoia National Park has amenities such as visitor centers, museum exhibits, and picnic areas. It's located adjacent to Kings Canyon National Park, and a single entry fee allows you to enter both parks.

Bear in mind, help protect the park by following the Leave No Trace principles, and do not take anything from the park, not even a pine cone. Also be prepared for limited cell service. Lastly, the park is at a high elevation, so you may feel effects from the altitude.
